1. How to check variables's type?

    -> Using interactive mode.
    For example:
        >>> type("My name is Khanh")
        <type, str>
        >>> type(23)
        <type, int>
        >>> type(23,4)
        <type, float>

2.  In what cases, you will get SyntaxError from the compiler telling you that some of your variables have invalid names?
    Can you give 3 different examples of invalid names?

    ->
    _ Name doesn't begin with a letter
            Example: 4gr = "Group 4"
    _ Containing illegal characters
            Example: Money$ = "Money in dollars"
    _ Using Python keywords's as a variables's name:
            Example: class = "Alo alo alo"
